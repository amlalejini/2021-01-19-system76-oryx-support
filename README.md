# 2021-01-19 System76 oryx support issue

This repository contains information related to my 2021-01-19 support ticket for a System76 Oryx laptop screen failure.

During use, the laptop's screen became distorted, and over a period of five to ten minutes, blacked out. On restart, only the top half-inch of the screen displays anything; the rest of the screen remains blacked out. The laptop is able to display correctly to an external monitor.
