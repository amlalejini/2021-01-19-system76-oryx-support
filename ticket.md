## Problem

During use, the laptop's screen became distorted, and over a period of five to ten minutes, blacked out.

On restart, only the top half-inch of the screen displays anything; the rest of the screen remains blacked out ([image 1](https://lalejini.com/2021-01-19-system76-oryx-support/media/IMG_0617.png)). If left alone for a few minutes, the screen gets funkier ([image 2](https://lalejini.com/2021-01-19-system76-oryx-support/media/IMG_0620.png)).

The laptop _is_ able to display correctly to an external monitor.

I made no changes to my system between the screen working and not working.
